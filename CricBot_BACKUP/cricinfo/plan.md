# Plan for Modifications to actions/actions.py

## Overview
The `actions/actions.py` file contains various action classes for a Rasa-based application that interacts with a Firestore database to provide cricket-related statistics. The classes are organized into groups based on their functionality.

## Proposed Modifications
1. **Enhance Error Handling:**
   - Improve error messages to provide more context when exceptions occur.
   - Implement logging for errors to track issues in production.

2. **Add New Action Classes:**
   - Create new action classes for additional statistics or queries that may be relevant to users.
   - Examples could include:
     - Player performance in specific matches.
     - Historical comparisons between teams.

3. **Optimize Query Performance:**
   - Review Firestore queries to ensure they are efficient and make use of indexes where necessary.
   - Consider adding pagination for results to improve user experience.

4. **Standardize Responses:**
   - Ensure that all response formats are consistent across different action classes.
   - Create a utility function to format responses uniformly.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add docstrings to all classes and methods to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Create a README file to explain how to use the action classes and their expected inputs/outputs.

## Next Steps
- Review the current functionality of each action class.
- Implement the proposed modifications iteratively, testing each change thoroughly.
- Update the documentation as changes are made.
